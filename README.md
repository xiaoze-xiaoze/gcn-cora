## Project Overview

**🎯 This project is the third installment in our beginner-friendly deep learning code tutorial series, designed for learners who want to understand Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Through detailed principle explanations and line-by-line code analysis, we help you deeply understand how Graph Convolutional Networks work on graph-structured data.**

This tutorial will guide you from traditional neural networks (MLP, CNN) to Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), using PyTorch Geometric to build a neural network specifically designed for graph data to perform node classification on the Cora citation network dataset. We will thoroughly explain why GCNs are essential for graph data and how they differ from traditional neural networks.

The **Cora dataset** is a classic benchmark in graph neural networks, containing 2,708 scientific publications classified into 7 research areas. Each publication is described by a 1,433-dimensional feature vector indicating the presence/absence of corresponding words, and citations between papers form the graph structure.

> **📚 Series Connection**: This is a special standalone episode in our beginner-friendly deep learning tutorial series. Unlike our previous tutorials that focus on traditional neural networks (MLP, CNN), this tutorial explores a completely different domain - graph neural networks. This episode is **completely independent** and requires no prior knowledge from previous tutorials. We'll explain everything from scratch, including basic graph theory, neural network fundamentals, and advanced GCN implementations. This serves as an introduction to how neural networks can be adapted for graph-structured data.

## From Traditional Networks to Graph Networks: Why We Need GCNs

### Limitations of Traditional Neural Networks on Graph Data

#### 1. **MLP Limitations on Graphs**
```
Problem: MLP treats each node independently
- Cannot capture relationships between nodes
- Ignores valuable graph structure information
- Poor performance on relational data
```

#### 2. **CNN Limitations on Graphs**
```
Problem: CNN assumes regular grid structure
- Graphs have irregular, non-Euclidean structure
- Variable number of neighbors per node
- No natural ordering of neighbors
```

### Why Graphs Are Everywhere

Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in real-world applications:
- **Social Networks**: Users and friendships
- **Citation Networks**: Papers and citations (our Cora dataset)
- **Molecular Structures**: Atoms and bonds
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Entities and relationships
- **Transportation Networks**: Locations and routes
- **Web Pages**: Pages and hyperlinks

### Core Advantages of GCNs

#### 1. **Natural Graph Processing**
```
Traditional: Node features only → Limited information
GCN: Node features + Graph structure → Rich relational information
```

#### 2. **Message Passing Mechanism**
- Each node aggregates information from its neighbors
- Information propagates through the graph structure
- Learns both local and global graph patterns

#### 3. **Semi-supervised Learning**
- Leverages both labeled and unlabeled nodes
- Graph structure provides additional supervision signal
- Particularly effective when labeled data is scarce

#### 4. **Permutation Invariance**
- Output doesn't depend on node ordering
- Naturally handles irregular graph structures
- Robust to different graph representations

## Graph Theory Fundamentals

### Basic Graph Concepts

#### 1. **Graph Definition**
A graph G = (V, E) consists of:
- **V**: Set of vertices (nodes) - in Cora: research papers
- **E**: Set of edges (links) - in Cora: citation relationships

#### 2. **Graph Representations**

**Adjacency Matrix (A)**:
```
A[i,j] = 1 if there's an edge between node i and j
A[i,j] = 0 otherwise

For Cora: A[i,j] = 1 if paper i cites paper j
```

**Node Feature Matrix (X)**:
```
X ∈ R^(N×F) where:
- N = number of nodes (2,708 for Cora)
- F = feature dimension (1,433 for Cora)
- X[i,:] = feature vector for node i
```

#### 3. **Graph Properties**
- **Degree**: Number of neighbors a node has
- **Path**: Sequence of connected nodes
- **Connected Component**: Subgraph where all nodes are reachable
- **Homophily**: Tendency for similar nodes to be connected

### Why Graph Structure Matters

#### Homophily Principle
In many real-world graphs, connected nodes tend to be similar:
- **Citation Networks**: Papers citing each other often share research topics
- **Social Networks**: Friends often have similar interests
- **Molecular Graphs**: Connected atoms have related chemical properties

This principle is crucial for GCNs - they leverage the assumption that neighboring nodes should have similar representations.

## GCN Architecture Deep Dive

### Network Structure Design

Our GCN adopts a simple yet effective 2-layer architecture:

```
Input Layer (1433 features)     → Node feature vectors
    ↓
GCN Layer 1 (1433 → 16)        → First graph convolution + ReLU
    ↓
Dropout Layer (p=0.5)           → Regularization to prevent overfitting
    ↓
GCN Layer 2 (16 → 7)           → Second graph convolution (output logits)
    ↓
Output Layer (7 classes)        → Final classification probabilities
```

### Architecture Design Principles

#### 1. **Two-Layer Design**
```python
self.conv1 = GCNConv(data.num_features, 16)  # 1433 → 16
self.conv2 = GCNConv(16, dataset.num_classes)  # 16 → 7
```

**Why only 2 layers?**
- **Over-smoothing Problem**: Deep GCNs tend to make all node representations similar
- **Small Dataset**: Cora is relatively small, doesn't need very deep networks
- **Effective Receptive Field**: 2 layers can capture 2-hop neighborhood information
- **Computational Efficiency**: Faster training and inference

#### 2. **Hidden Dimension Choice (16)**
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: From 1433 to 16 is significant compression
- **Feature Learning**: Forces model to learn most important features
- **Overfitting Prevention**: Smaller hidden dimension reduces model complexity
- **Empirical Optimum**: 16 dimensions work well for Cora dataset

#### 3. **Dropout Regularization (p=0.5)**
- **Critical for Small Datasets**: Cora has only 140 training nodes
- **Prevents Overfitting**: Randomly sets 50% of neurons to zero during training
- **Improves Generalization**: Forces model to not rely on specific neurons
- **Standard Practice**: 0.5 is commonly used dropout rate

### Comparison with Traditional Architectures

#### GCN vs MLP
```
MLP Architecture:
Input (1433) → Hidden (128) → Hidden (64) → Output (7)
- Treats each node independently
- ~125K parameters
- No graph structure utilization

GCN Architecture:
Input (1433) → GCN (16) → GCN (7)
- Considers node neighborhoods
- ~23K parameters
- Leverages graph structure
```

#### GCN vs CNN
```
CNN: Designed for grid-like data (images)
- Fixed neighborhood size (e.g., 3×3 kernels)
- Regular structure assumption
- Translation invariance

GCN: Designed for graph data
- Variable neighborhood size
- Irregular structure handling
- Permutation invariance
```

## Graph Convolution Mathematical Principles

### The Core GCN Formula

The fundamental GCN operation is defined as:

```
H^(l+1) = σ(D̃^(-1/2) Ã D̃^(-1/2) H^(l) W^(l))
```

Where:
- **H^(l)**: Node representations at layer l
- **Ã**: Adjacency matrix with self-loops (A + I)
- **D̃**: Degree matrix of Ã
- **W^(l)**: Learnable weight matrix at layer l
- **σ**: Activation function (ReLU)

### Breaking Down the Formula

#### 1. **Adding Self-Loops: Ã = A + I**
```python
# Original adjacency matrix A
A[i,j] = 1 if edge exists between node i and j

# Add self-loops: Ã = A + I
Ã[i,i] = 1 for all nodes i
```

**Why self-loops?**
- Ensures each node considers its own features
- Prevents information loss during aggregation
- Mathematical stability in the normalization

#### 2. **Degree Matrix: D̃**
```python
# Degree matrix (diagonal)
D̃[i,i] = sum of row i in Ã
D̃[i,j] = 0 for i ≠ j
```

#### 3. **Symmetric Normalization: D̃^(-1/2) Ã D̃^(-1/2)**
This normalization ensures:
- **Scale Invariance**: Nodes with different degrees are treated fairly
- **Numerical Stability**: Prevents exploding/vanishing gradients
- **Symmetric Matrix**: Maintains mathematical properties

### Intuitive Understanding

#### Message Passing Perspective
```python
# For each node i:
new_feature_i = σ(Σ(normalized_weight * neighbor_feature * W))

# Where:
# - We sum over all neighbors (including self)
# - Each neighbor's contribution is normalized by degree
# - Features are transformed by learnable weights W
```

#### Aggregation Process
1. **Collect**: Gather features from all neighbors
2. **Normalize**: Weight by node degrees to prevent bias
3. **Transform**: Apply learnable linear transformation
4. **Activate**: Apply non-linear activation (ReLU)

### Why This Formula Works

#### 1. **Local Smoothing**
- Nodes become similar to their neighbors
- Leverages homophily assumption
- Gradually propagates information through graph

#### 2. **Feature Learning**
- Weight matrix W learns task-specific transformations
- Different layers learn different levels of abstraction
- Combines local structure with global learning

#### 3. **Scalability**
- Sparse matrix operations are efficient
- Linear complexity in number of edges
- Parallelizable across nodes

### Implementation in PyTorch Geometric

```python
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

# PyTorch Geometric handles all the complex math
conv = GCNConv(in_channels=1433, out_channels=16)

# Forward pass
x_new = conv(x, edge_index)  # Automatically applies the GCN formula
```

**What PyTorch Geometric does internally:**
1. Constructs normalized adjacency matrix
2. Performs sparse matrix multiplication
3. Applies learnable transformation
4. Returns updated node features

## Model Implementation & Code Analysis

### GCN Class Structure

```python
class GCN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dropout=0.5):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(data.num_features, 16)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(16, dataset.num_classes)
        self.dropout = dropout

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        # First GCN layer
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = F.dropout(x, p=self.dropout, training=self.training)

        # Second GCN layer
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        return x

    def embed(self, x, edge_index):
        # For visualization - returns first layer embeddings
        return F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
```

### Layer-by-Layer Analysis

#### 1. **First GCN Layer**
```python
self.conv1 = GCNConv(data.num_features, 16)
```
- **Input**: 1433-dimensional node features
- **Output**: 16-dimensional node embeddings
- **Parameters**: 1433 × 16 + 16 = 22,944 parameters
- **Function**: Learns initial graph-aware representations

#### 2. **ReLU Activation**
```python
x = F.relu(x)
```
- **Purpose**: Introduces non-linearity
- **Effect**: Allows model to learn complex patterns
- **Alternative**: Could use other activations (LeakyReLU, ELU)

#### 3. **Dropout Layer**
```python
x = F.dropout(x, p=self.dropout, training=self.training)
```
- **Dropout Rate**: 0.5 (50% of neurons set to zero)
- **Training Only**: Only active during training, not inference
- **Critical**: Essential for preventing overfitting on small Cora dataset

#### 4. **Second GCN Layer**
```python
self.conv2 = GCNConv(16, dataset.num_classes)
```
- **Input**: 16-dimensional embeddings from first layer
- **Output**: 7-dimensional class logits
- **Parameters**: 16 × 7 + 7 = 119 parameters
- **Function**: Maps embeddings to class predictions

### Parameter Count Analysis

```python
Total Parameters:
- conv1: 1433 × 16 + 16 = 22,944
- conv2: 16 × 7 + 7 = 119
- Total: 23,063 parameters

Comparison:
- GCN: ~23K parameters
- MLP (from previous tutorial): ~126K parameters
- Parameter Reduction: ~82% fewer parameters!
```

**Why so few parameters?**
- **Shared Computation**: Graph convolution shares computation across nodes
- **Structural Inductive Bias**: Graph structure provides implicit regularization
- **Efficient Architecture**: 2-layer design is sufficient for Cora

### Forward Pass Detailed Flow

```python
def forward(self, x, edge_index):
    # Input: x.shape = (2708, 1433), edge_index.shape = (2, 10556)

    # First layer: Graph convolution
    x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)  # (2708, 1433) → (2708, 16)

    # Activation: Add non-linearity
    x = F.relu(x)  # (2708, 16) → (2708, 16)

    # Dropout: Regularization (training only)
    x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training)  # (2708, 16) → (2708, 16)

    # Second layer: Final classification
    x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)  # (2708, 16) → (2708, 7)

    # Output: Raw logits for each class
    return x  # (2708, 7)
```

### Embedding Function for Visualization

```python
def embed(self, x, edge_index):
    return F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
```

**Purpose**:
- Extracts intermediate representations from first layer
- Used for t-SNE visualization
- Helps understand what the model learns
- Debugging and interpretation tool

## Training Process & Overfitting Considerations

### Training Configuration

```python
model = GCN().to(device)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=5e-4)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
```

#### Key Training Parameters
- **Learning Rate**: 0.01 (higher than CNN/MLP due to fewer parameters)
- **Weight Decay**: 5e-4 (L2 regularization to prevent overfitting)
- **Optimizer**: Adam (adaptive learning rate)
- **Epochs**: 200 (more epochs needed due to small training set)

### The Overfitting Challenge

#### Why GCNs Easily Overfit on Cora

1. **Extremely Small Training Set**
   - Only 140 labeled nodes out of 2,708 total (5.2%)
   - High-dimensional features (1,433 dimensions)
   - Risk of memorizing training examples

2. **Graph Structure Complexity**
   - Rich connectivity patterns
   - Model can exploit specific graph structures
   - May not generalize to unseen graph patterns

3. **High Model Capacity**
   - Despite fewer parameters, GCNs are still expressive
   - Can fit complex decision boundaries
   - Graph convolution provides additional modeling power

#### Overfitting Detection Strategy

**Key Insight**: Test accuracy above 81% often indicates overfitting!

```python
# Monitor validation accuracy during training
if val_acc > best_val_acc:
    best_val_acc = val_acc
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'best_model.pt')

# Warning signs of overfitting:
# 1. Validation accuracy > 81%
# 2. Large gap between train and validation accuracy
# 3. Validation accuracy starts decreasing while training accuracy increases
```

**Why 81% threshold?**
- Empirical observation from GCN research
- Cora dataset characteristics make >81% suspicious
- Balance between model performance and generalization
- Prevents overly optimistic results

#### Overfitting Prevention Techniques

1. **Dropout Regularization**
```python
x = F.dropout(x, p=0.5, training=self.training)
```
- Randomly zeros 50% of neurons during training
- Forces model to not rely on specific features
- Critical for small datasets like Cora

2. **Weight Decay (L2 Regularization)**
```python
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=5e-4)
```
- Penalizes large weights
- Encourages simpler models
- Prevents parameter explosion

3. **Early Stopping**
```python
# Stop training when validation accuracy stops improving
patience = 10
if val_acc <= best_val_acc:
    patience_counter += 1
    if patience_counter >= patience:
        break
```

4. **Model Architecture Choices**
- Only 2 layers (prevents over-smoothing)
- Small hidden dimension (16)
- Simple architecture reduces overfitting risk

### Training Loop Analysis

```python
def train():
    model.train()  # Enable dropout
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    out = model(data.x, data.edge_index)
    loss = criterion(out[data.train_mask], data.y[data.train_mask])
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    return loss.item()
```

#### Key Training Aspects

1. **Semi-supervised Learning**
   - Forward pass on ALL nodes (2,708)
   - Loss computed only on training nodes (140)
   - Unlabeled nodes still contribute to representation learning

2. **Mask-based Training**
   - `data.train_mask`: Boolean mask for training nodes
   - Only training node predictions used for loss
   - Validation/test nodes used for evaluation only

3. **Full Graph Processing**
   - Entire graph processed in each forward pass
   - No mini-batching (unlike traditional deep learning)
   - Graph structure requires global processing

### Randomness and Reproducibility

#### Sources of Randomness in GCN Training

1. **Weight Initialization**
   - Random initialization of GCN layers
   - Different starting points lead to different solutions

2. **Dropout Randomness**
   - Random neuron selection during training
   - Different dropout patterns each epoch

3. **Optimization Randomness**
   - Adam optimizer internal randomness
   - Gradient computation numerical precision

#### Ensuring Reproducible Results

```python
def set_seed(seed=42):
    random.seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
```

**Why Multiple Runs Are Important**:
- Single run may be lucky/unlucky
- Average performance over multiple runs is more reliable
- Standard deviation indicates result stability
- Helps identify consistent vs. random improvements

#### Recommended Experimental Protocol

```python
# Run multiple experiments with different seeds
seeds = [42, 123, 456, 789, 999]
results = []

for seed in seeds:
    set_seed(seed)
    model = GCN().to(device)
    # ... train model ...
    test_acc = evaluate_model()
    results.append(test_acc)

print(f"Mean accuracy: {np.mean(results):.4f} ± {np.std(results):.4f}")
```

## Performance Analysis & Results

### Expected Performance Metrics

#### Typical GCN Performance on Cora
- **Training Accuracy**: 95-100% (often overfits)
- **Validation Accuracy**: 75-81% (key metric to watch)
- **Test Accuracy**: 70-85% (varies significantly with randomness)
- **Training Time**: 10-30 seconds (very fast due to small dataset)

#### Performance Comparison

| Method | Test Accuracy | Parameters | Training Time |
|--------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **Random Baseline** | ~14.3% | 0 | 0s |
| **MLP (features only)** | ~55-65% | ~126K | 2-3 min |
| **GCN (our implementation)** | **70-85%** | ~23K | 10-30s |
| **Advanced GCNs** | 80-85% | Varies | Varies |

### Understanding the Results

#### Why GCN Outperforms MLP
1. **Graph Structure Utilization**
   - MLP: Uses only node features (1,433-dim vectors)
   - GCN: Uses features + graph structure (citations)
   - Citation relationships provide valuable information

2. **Semi-supervised Learning**
   - MLP: Only learns from 140 labeled nodes
   - GCN: Learns from all 2,708 nodes (structure + features)
   - Unlabeled nodes contribute to representation learning

3. **Inductive Bias**
   - MLP: No assumptions about data structure
   - GCN: Assumes similar nodes are connected (homophily)
   - This assumption holds well for citation networks

#### Performance Variability

**High Variance in Results**:
- Different random seeds can give 70-85% accuracy
- 15% performance range is significant
- Due to small training set and model sensitivity

**Factors Affecting Performance**:
1. **Random Initialization**: Different starting weights
2. **Dropout Patterns**: Random neuron selection
3. **Training Dynamics**: Optimization path variations
4. **Data Splits**: Fixed but small training set

#### Interpreting "Good" Performance

**Conservative Interpretation**:
- Test accuracy 70-75%: Solid, likely not overfitted
- Test accuracy 75-80%: Good performance, monitor for overfitting
- Test accuracy >81%: Excellent but possibly overfitted

**Red Flags for Overfitting**:
- Validation accuracy much higher than expected
- Large gap between training and validation accuracy
- Performance drops significantly with different seeds

## Visualization and Interpretation

### t-SNE Visualization

Our implementation includes t-SNE visualization of learned embeddings:

```python
@torch.no_grad()
def plot():
    model.eval()
    emb = model.embed(data.x, data.edge_index).cpu()  # Get 16-dim embeddings
    tsne = TSNE(n_components=2)  # Reduce to 2D
    emb_2d = tsne.fit_transform(emb)  # Apply t-SNE

    plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
    sns.scatterplot(x=emb_2d[:,0], y=emb_2d[:,1],
                    hue=data.y.cpu(), palette='tab10', s=15)
    plt.title('GCN embeddings (t-SNE)')
    plt.legend(title='Class')
    plt.show()
```

#### What t-SNE Shows

1. **Cluster Formation**
   - Well-trained GCN creates distinct clusters
   - Each cluster corresponds to a research area
   - Clear separation indicates good feature learning

2. **Class Separation**
   - Different colors (classes) should be spatially separated
   - Overlapping regions indicate classification difficulty
   - Tight clusters suggest strong intra-class similarity

3. **Graph Structure Influence**
   - Connected nodes tend to be close in embedding space
   - Citation relationships preserved in learned representations
   - Demonstrates successful graph structure utilization

#### Interpreting Visualization Results

**Good Visualization**:
- Clear cluster boundaries
- Minimal class overlap
- Smooth transitions between related classes

**Poor Visualization**:
- Mixed clusters
- No clear separation
- Random distribution of classes

### Training Curves Analysis

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12,4))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.plot(train_losses, label='Training Loss')
plt.title('Training Loss Curve')

plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.plot(train_accs, label='Train Accuracy')
plt.plot(val_accs, label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.title('Accuracy Curve')
```

#### What Training Curves Reveal

1. **Loss Curve Analysis**
   - Smooth decrease: Good training dynamics
   - Oscillations: Learning rate too high or instability
   - Plateau: Convergence or need for longer training

2. **Accuracy Gap Analysis**
   - Small gap: Good generalization
   - Large gap: Overfitting (train >> validation)
   - Increasing gap: Progressive overfitting

3. **Convergence Patterns**
   - Fast convergence: Good architecture/hyperparameters
   - Slow convergence: Need hyperparameter adjustment
   - No convergence: Fundamental issues

### Feature Importance Analysis

While not implemented in our basic version, you can analyze what the GCN learns:

```python
# Analyze first layer weights
conv1_weights = model.conv1.weight.data  # Shape: (16, 1433)

# Find most important input features for each hidden unit
for i in range(16):
    top_features = torch.topk(conv1_weights[i], k=10)
    print(f"Hidden unit {i} top features: {top_features.indices}")
```

This analysis can reveal:
- Which words/features are most important
- How different hidden units specialize
- Whether the model learns meaningful patterns

## Line-by-Line Code Analysis

### 1. Import Statements and Dependencies

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.datasets import Planetoid
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

### 2. Random Seed Setting

```python
def set_seed(seed=42):
    random.seed(seed)                    # Python random module
    np.random.seed(seed)                 # NumPy random number generator
    torch.manual_seed(seed)              # PyTorch CPU random number generator
    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)     # PyTorch GPU random number generator
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True   # Deterministic CUDA operations
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False      # Disable CUDA optimization
```

**Why Each Line Matters**:
- **Line 2**: Controls Python's built-in random functions
- **Line 3**: Controls NumPy random operations (used by scikit-learn)
- **Line 4**: Controls PyTorch CPU tensor operations
- **Line 5**: Controls PyTorch GPU operations (if CUDA available)
- **Line 6**: Forces deterministic CUDA algorithms (may be slower)
- **Line 7**: Disables CUDA kernel optimization for reproducibility

### 3. Device Configuration and Data Loading

```python
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

dataset = Planetoid(root='Data', name='Cora')
data = dataset[0].to(device)
print(f'[Data] {data.num_nodes} nodes, {data.num_edges} edges, '
      f'{data.num_features} feats, {dataset.num_classes} classes.')
```

**Line-by-Line Analysis**:
- **Line 1**: Automatic GPU detection and selection
- **Line 3**: Downloads/loads Cora dataset to 'Data' directory
- **Line 4**: Extracts first (and only) graph, moves to GPU/CPU
- **Lines 5-6**: Prints dataset statistics for verification

**Expected Output**:
```
[Data] 2708 nodes, 10556 edges, 1433 feats, 7 classes.
```

### 4. GCN Model Definition

```python
class GCN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dropout=0.5):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(data.num_features, 16)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(16, dataset.num_classes)
        self.dropout = dropout
```

**Constructor Analysis**:
- **Line 2**: Inherits from PyTorch's nn.Module base class
- **Line 3**: Calls parent constructor (essential for PyTorch modules)
- **Line 4**: First GCN layer: 1433 input features → 16 hidden features
- **Line 5**: Second GCN layer: 16 hidden features → 7 output classes
- **Line 6**: Stores dropout probability for later use

### 5. Forward Pass Implementation

```python
def forward(self, x, edge_index):
    x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)                    # First graph convolution
    x = F.relu(x)                                    # ReLU activation
    x = F.dropout(x, p=self.dropout, training=self.training)  # Dropout regularization
    x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)                    # Second graph convolution
    return x
```

**Step-by-Step Execution**:
1. **Line 2**: Apply first GCN layer
   - Input: (2708, 1433) node features + edge information
   - Output: (2708, 16) hidden representations
   - Operation: Graph convolution with learnable weights

2. **Line 3**: Apply ReLU activation
   - Introduces non-linearity: max(0, x)
   - Enables learning of complex patterns
   - Standard choice for hidden layers

3. **Line 4**: Apply dropout (training only)
   - Randomly sets 50% of neurons to zero
   - Only active when model.training = True
   - Prevents overfitting on small dataset

4. **Line 5**: Apply second GCN layer
   - Input: (2708, 16) hidden features + edge information
   - Output: (2708, 7) class logits
   - Final transformation to class predictions

### 6. Embedding Function for Visualization

```python
def embed(self, x, edge_index):
    return F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
```

**Purpose and Usage**:
- Extracts intermediate 16-dimensional representations
- Used for t-SNE visualization and analysis
- Helps understand what first layer learns
- Debugging tool for model interpretation

### 7. Model Instantiation and Optimizer Setup

```python
model = GCN().to(device)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=5e-4)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
```

**Configuration Details**:
- **Line 1**: Create GCN instance and move to GPU/CPU
- **Line 2**: Adam optimizer with specific hyperparameters
  - `lr=0.01`: Learning rate (higher than typical CNN/MLP)
  - `weight_decay=5e-4`: L2 regularization strength
  - `model.parameters()`: All trainable parameters
- **Line 3**: Cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification

### 8. Training Function Implementation

```python
def train():
    model.train()                                    # Enable training mode
    optimizer.zero_grad()                            # Clear previous gradients
    out = model(data.x, data.edge_index)            # Forward pass on entire graph
    loss = criterion(out[data.train_mask], data.y[data.train_mask])  # Loss on training nodes only
    loss.backward()                                  # Compute gradients
    optimizer.step()                                 # Update parameters
    return loss.item()                               # Return scalar loss value
```

**Training Process Breakdown**:
1. **Line 2**: Sets model to training mode
   - Enables dropout during forward pass
   - Affects batch normalization (if present)

2. **Line 3**: Clears gradients from previous iteration
   - PyTorch accumulates gradients by default
   - Must clear before each backward pass

3. **Line 4**: Forward pass through entire graph
   - Processes all 2708 nodes simultaneously
   - Returns logits for all nodes

4. **Line 5**: Compute loss only on training nodes
   - `data.train_mask`: Boolean mask selecting 140 training nodes
   - Only supervised loss on labeled data
   - Semi-supervised learning approach

5. **Line 6**: Backward pass to compute gradients
   - Automatic differentiation through graph operations
   - Gradients stored in parameter.grad attributes

6. **Line 7**: Update model parameters
   - Adam optimizer applies computed gradients
   - Updates weights based on learning rate and momentum

### 9. Test Function Implementation

```python
@torch.no_grad()
def test(mask):
    model.eval()                                     # Set to evaluation mode
    logits = model(data.x, data.edge_index)         # Forward pass (no gradients)
    pred = logits[mask].argmax(1)                   # Get predictions for specified nodes
    acc = (pred == data.y[mask]).float().mean().item()  # Calculate accuracy
    return acc, pred.cpu()
```

**Evaluation Process Analysis**:
1. **Line 1**: `@torch.no_grad()` decorator
   - Disables gradient computation
   - Saves memory and speeds up inference
   - Essential for evaluation functions

2. **Line 3**: Set model to evaluation mode
   - Disables dropout (uses all neurons)
   - Changes batch normalization behavior
   - Ensures consistent inference

3. **Line 4**: Forward pass without gradient tracking
   - Same computation as training but more efficient
   - Processes entire graph

4. **Line 5**: Extract predictions for specified nodes
   - `mask`: Can be train_mask, val_mask, or test_mask
   - `argmax(1)`: Get class with highest probability
   - Converts logits to class predictions

5. **Line 6**: Calculate accuracy
   - Compare predictions with true labels
   - Convert boolean to float and take mean
   - `.item()` converts tensor to Python scalar

### 10. Visualization Function

@torch.no_grad()
def plot():
    model.eval()                                     # Evaluation mode
    emb = model.embed(data.x, data.edge_index).cpu() # Get 16-dim embeddings
    tsne = TSNE(n_components=2)                      # Initialize t-SNE
    emb_2d = tsne.fit_transform(emb)                 # Reduce to 2D

    plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))                        # Create figure
    sns.scatterplot(x=emb_2d[:,0], y=emb_2d[:,1],   # Scatter plot
                    hue=data.y.cpu(), palette='tab10', s=15)
    plt.title('GCN embeddings (t-SNE)')             # Add title
    plt.legend(title='Class')                        # Add legend
    plt.savefig('gcn_tsne.png', dpi=300)            # Save high-res image
    plt.show()                                       # Display plot
```
